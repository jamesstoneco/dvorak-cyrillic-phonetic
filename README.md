A Cyrillic Phonetic Keyboard Layout for Dvorak Typists

## Why would you want this?

**Dvorak** is an alternative typing layout for English based languages.  It is one of the most popular alternative layouts and if you have invested into Dvorak and haven't maintained your Qwerty touchtyping it can be quite awkward to go back.  

**Cyrillic Phonetic** is a keyboard layout that is designed to make typing Cyrillic for native english speakers easier, by transliterating (finding similar sounds and letters across both languages) the keys.  This often makes learning to type Cyrillic easier for English speakers because it doesn't require memorizing a completly new layout that is the typical Cyrillic layout.  

I couldn't find a Dvorak based one for macOS so created one using [ukelele](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele).  Also instrumental was [on how to create a keyboard layout for macosx on Super User](http://superuser.com/questions/665494/how-to-make-a-custom-keyboard-layout-in-macos) explaining the process step-by-step.  

**NOTE: Requires use of the command line for installation.**
